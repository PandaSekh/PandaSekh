I wanted to learn some game development and after discovering the Game Jam concept I thought it would be a good goal to achieve. I had a month before Ludum Dare 46 started.
In this post I would like to do an analysis of the mistakes I made while developing my first &ldquo;game&rdquo;.</p><img src=/blog/first-game-jam-post-mortem/logo_hu95feea6b6a654d1506e5d66ed1f606ca_103377_640x512_resize_q70_h2_catmullrom.webp alt="The Flame of Life logo"><p>Github Repo: <a href=https://github.com/PandaSekh/LudumDare_46>Link</a><br>Play online: <a href=https://pandasekh.itch.io/the-flame-of-life>Link</a></p><h2 id=whats-a-game-jam>What&rsquo;s a Game Jam?</h2><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam>Wikipedia</a> has a great explanation:
<em>A game jam is a contest where participants try to make a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game title="Video game">video game</a> from scratch. Depending on the format, participants might work independently, or in teams. The contest duration usually ranges from 24 to 72 hours.</em></p><p>Rules vary depending on the actual contest. In Ludum Dare, a theme is chosen by vote and participants have 72 hours to submit the game.
The theme for Ludum Dare 46 was &ldquo;Keep it alive&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=code-art-sound-music>Code, Art, Sound, Music</h2><p>If you want to partecipate in a game jam without a team it might be hard to do all the above yourself. I can code and I enjoy it, but I dread anything artistic. Luckily, you can use assets created by other people (of course only if the game jam and the original author allows it), and I suggest that you take advantage of that.
At first I tried to create my own assets, but It&rsquo;s really hard and time consuming creating original music for a game if you have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing.
Luckily I didn&rsquo;t waste too much time and after a few hours of trying I gave up creating my own assets and just used something already done by others. It&rsquo;s not a bad thing to use something created by someone else.</p><p>Suggestion: Don&rsquo;t be afraid to use assets created by others (if they allow it).</p><img src=/blog/first-game-jam-post-mortem/gameplay_hu93a1f94f2b434621f9555e3cec7e2d1c_88478_954x595_resize_q70_h2_catmullrom.webp alt="The Flame of Life Gameplay Screenshot"><h2 id=make-it-enjoyable>Make It Enjoyable</h2><p>Before even knowing the theme, I knew I wanted to create a game with an high level of difficulty.
I don&rsquo;t know why, but I love to create hard games (I previusly did some basic level design on other games and I loved to make my levels as hard as possible).
The problem is that in a game jam contest the games are rated by other participants, so it wasn&rsquo;t a great idea to make it so difficult that only a fraction of the players would enjoy it.
Also, making hard games is&mldr; hard. You need to correctly balance the game so that it&rsquo;s difficult, but not unfair. You have to give players the ability to learn and beat it with ease, you can&rsquo;t just massacre them in the tutorial level.
Well, I didn&rsquo;t think too much about that. In my game the flame of your torch fades with time and if it goes off you&rsquo;re dead. In the first level I put some text to create a basic story and to do a quick tutorial.
Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t test it by actually reading and comprehending the tutorial texts I had put in, because I already knew what I wrote, so It didn&rsquo;t came to mind that I should&rsquo;ve stopped the flame fading during that first tutorial. Basically players would die while reading why they were dying. Not a great game design.</p><p>Suggestion: Make sure that your game is enjoyable.</p><h2 id=make-it-clear>Make It Clear</h2><p>Still following my desire to make an &ldquo;hard&rdquo; game, I didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the gameplay to players too much.
Unfortunately, people playing games in a Game Jam competition are participants too and they have to play a minimum amount of games before their own game can be awarded. As such, they usually won&rsquo;t waste more time than what&rsquo;s necessary on a game. They can&rsquo;t just wander around my game trying to understand what the best path is, or to discover new dynamics.</p><p>Suggestion: Make the gameplay clear.</p><p>I think that&rsquo;s all. That experience was fun and I hope I&rsquo;ll be able to do it again one day.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
