Now we need to program the API endpoints to communicate with Github&amp;rsquo;s API in order to save and retrieve the comments.

While I already did a commenting system, it was using an external CMS (Sanity.io). Sanity is great, but for this project I had two different goals:

In this third and final article we&amp;rsquo;ll add Emoji Reactions. This is going to be useful because people can interact with your content without the need to write a comment.

One of the features I wanted was a commenting system, but none of those already available were interesting for me and I wanted full control on the features and the data. Because of that, I decided to create my own commenting system.
