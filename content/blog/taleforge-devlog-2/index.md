It‚Äôs been an intense few days of development on TaleForge, and the project is gaining momentum fast. I've been laser-focused on improving UX, optimizing the underlying AI functionality, and preparing for the upcoming beta launch. Here's a deep dive into what's new, what's improved, and what's next.

## Major Updates & Improvements

### üöÄ Domain Officially Purchased
TaleForge now has an official home: **[taleforge.app](https://taleforge.app)** ($14.18). A small but essential step towards building a professional and recognizable brand.

### üé® Improved Typography and Logo
Previously, the site's title was a basic Arial font. I've improved typography and logo design to something more pleasing and professional. It's probably not the final version, but it's a noticeable step up.

### üõ†Ô∏è AI Enhancements
- **Unified Lambda Endpoint**: I streamlined all APIs about AI analyses into a single endpoint, Then, I've further optimized it by improving its code structure and performance, significantly enhancing reliability and cost-efficiency.
- **Location Support**: The function now supports structured extraction and management of location data‚Äîanother key piece of the storytelling puzzle.
- **Story Support**: The function now extract key information about stories.
- **Multi Language**: The analysis supports response language selection (though I'm planning to refine this further with custom, translated prompts).
- 
### ‚úçÔ∏è Editable Fields & Better Flexibility
All fields within TaleForge‚Äîcharacter sheets, locations, notes‚Äîare now editable. Users aren't locked into their AI-generated content; instead, they have full creative control.

### üñºÔ∏è UX Overhaul for Image Uploading
The original image upload UX was a bit of a disaster, offering zero feedback to users after uploading. Now it's polished, intuitive, and fully production-ready‚Äîfinally!

### üéß Audio Transcripts
- Written the code to support audio transcription, making audio memos a reality.

### üî¢ Project Insights & Notes Management
- **Story Elements Count**: The projects overview now clearly displays counts of characters, locations, and notes‚Äîan easy way to grasp project complexity at a glance.
- **Readded & Editable Notes**: Users can again add and manage notes, including deletion when necessary.
- **Note Search**: Quickly find notes by keyword, further streamlining content navigation.

### üì© SMTP via Resend & Magic Link Authentication
- I integrated [Resend](https://resend.com/) for programmatic email sending and as an SMTP server, leveraging their excellent free tier.
- The contact form on the new contact page now actually works (emails reach me directly!).
- To simplify user onboarding and improve UX, I've implemented Sign-in/Sign-up via magic link, completely removing password complexity.

### üì¶ Project Export as ZIP
Users can export their projects as ZIP files, conveniently packaging all character sheets, location details, notes, and story information as PDFs, Markdown, or DOCX. This makes it easy to backup or migrate project data.

### üîó GitHub Project Management
I've set up a structured GitHub board to better handle work items, manage my workflow, and stay organized‚Äîcritical steps towards long-term project sustainability.

## Expenses vs. Gains (So Far)
New costs incurred:

| Item                | Cost   |
|---------------------|--------|
| Domain (taleforge.app) | $14.18 |
| Previous total      | $51.10 |
| **New total**       | **$65.28** |

**Gains:** $0 (still!)

## Interesting Read & Prompt Improvements
An intriguing read worth sharing: [Sophia Yang's deep dive into OpenAI structured outputs with Zod schemas](https://sophiabits.com/blog/openai-structured-outputs-deep-dive). Inspired by this, I've begun refining TaleForge‚Äôs prompts to be more robust, reliable, and structured.

## Next Steps (Beta Launch Preparation)
Here‚Äôs what's on the immediate horizon as I approach beta readiness:

- **User Onboarding**: Create a clear, welcoming onboarding experience to guide first-time users.
- **Feedback Strategy**: Decide how I'll gather user feedback: manual forms, a Discord community, or both.
- **"Ask TaleForge" Feature**: Implement functionality that lets users directly query TaleForge about their own story content‚Äîleveraging all existing notes and analysis.
- **PostHog Configuration**: Better setup PostHog tracking to gather insightful analytics on user interactions.
- **Frontend Cleanup**: Remove frontend logs and polish the experience.
- **Privacy & Compliance**: Carefully review and enhance the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, setting up robust cookie management that allows users clear opt-out options for tracking.

That's it for Dev Log #2!
