I spend most of my time programming or reading. Other than that, I&apos;m passionate about:
- Gardening
- Writing
- Self-hosting (I have a server that I use for various stuff)
- Drawing (still learning)

On this blog I mostly write about programming stuff. On [Arte della Lettura](https://www.artedellalettura.it) I write about the books I read (in italian).
