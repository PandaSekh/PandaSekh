I spend most of my time programming or reading. Other than that, I&apos;m passionate about:
- Gardening
- Writing
- Self-hosting (I have a server that I use for various stuff)
- Drawing (still learning)

On this blog I mostly write about programming stuff.

If you have feedback, suggestions or corrections, please feel free to contact me vie email (it can be found in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/PandaSekh)) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PandaSekh).
