Hi there! I'm Alessio, a Software Engineer from Italy.

I spend most of my free time programming, reading, writing, and gardening. I'm passionate about exploring different programming languages and technologies, always looking for new challenges to improve my skills.

When I’m not coding or learning something new, you’ll probably find me in my hot pepper garden. Gardening is both relaxing and rewarding—I love experimenting with different plant varieties and growing techniques.

I also enjoy writing, tinkering with my servers (one large machine and several Raspberry Pis), and learning to draw. I’m still a beginner, but I’m having fun with it!

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out via email (which you can find on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/PandaSekh)).
