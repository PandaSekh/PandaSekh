Hi there, I'm Alessio, a Software Engineer from Italy!
Programming, learning new things, and gardening are my main hobbies, and they take up most of my free time. I'm passionate about exploring different programming languages and technologies, and I'm constantly seeking out new ways to challenge myself and improve my skills.

When I'm not coding or studying, I like to spend time tending to my hot peppers garden. I find gardening to be a relaxing and fulfilling activity, and I enjoy experimenting with different plant varieties and growing techniques.

I'm also passionate about writing, thinkering with my servers (a big one and several Raspberries) and drawing (I'm still learning!).

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or corrections, please feel free to contact me via email (which you can find on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/PandaSekh)) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@pandasekh).
